## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Crystal Daniel

### About Me
ðŸŽ“ I'm currently studying computer science at Wright State University

### Current Projects:
1. Oinkers â€“ A pig farming sim with a twist

I'm developing a farming simulator where genetically modified pigs produce unusual goods (like a feathery pig that lays eggs!). This concept combines my love for collecting pig-related items with my passion for farming sims that have a touch of fantasy or sci-fi. The game, coded in Java, currently features movement mechanics, sprite placement, enemies, and image layering. The story follows a pig farmer within a futuristic world who works with a mad scientist to mutate pigs, with some mutations going hilariously wrong leading to monster battles and experience points!

2. Worldbuilding App â€“ Inspired by Character Story Planner 2

I'm creating a world-building app inspired by Character Story Planner 2. While using CSP2 I found the unique feature of creating and posting templates with named textboxes, range sliders, and custom selections to be very useful when documenting relevant information about my personal story. The infinite customizable experience is what I strive to make for all creatives and their unique needs. My app will feature desktop use, drag-and-drop elements, an improved UI, and additional tools to make creation seamlessly personalized and easy.
