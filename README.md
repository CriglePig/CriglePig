### Current Projects:
1. Oinkers â€“ A pig farming sim with a twist

I'm developing a farming simulator where genetically modified pigs produce unusual goods (like pigs that lay eggs!). This concept combines my love for collecting pig-related items with my passion for farming sims that have a touch of fantasy or sci-fi. The game, coded in Java, currently features movement mechanics, sprite placement, enemies, and image layering. The story follows a pig farmer within a futuristic world who works with a mad scientist to mutate pigs, with some mutations going hilariously wrong leading to monster battles and experience points!

2. Worldbuilding App â€“ Inspired by Character Story Planner 2

I'm building a worldbuilding app inspired by Character Story Planner 2, but with improvements for desktop use. My version will feature drag-and-drop elements, an improved UI, and additional tools to make organizing and creating easier.
